Responsive weather application

This was one of the first projects I have done and I mainly focused on learning the basic concepts of APIs and responsive layout.
So, I conceptualized and developed a responsive weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with seamless integration of APIs for real-time data retrieval. This project involved UI/UX design, responsive layout implementation, and JavaScript functionality for interactive features.
